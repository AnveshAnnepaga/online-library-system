## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement

This project demonstrates how to build a **real-world Library Management System** using Python and Supabase/Postgres.  
It simulates actual library operations like managing members, handling books, processing borrowing and returns, and generating reports.  

### Requirements:
- Create tables for **Members, Books, and Borrow Records** in Postgres  
- Implement **CRUD operations**:  
  - Register new members  
  - Add, update, search, and delete books  
  - Borrow/return books with stock checks  
- Implement **safe transactions** for borrowing/returning  
- Generate useful reports (overdue books, most borrowed books)  
- Only allow deletion if constraints are met (e.g., no borrowed books)
